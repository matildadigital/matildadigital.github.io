							<h1>Bridge Headset Apps Collection</h1>
							<p class="major"><a href="http://www.occipital.com">Occipital</a>'s Bridge Headset powered by Structure Sensor has an increasing number of available apps. Their product website needed an evergreen design that could transform into more of an apps store. After researching current solutions and customer needs, I created this UI design.</p>

							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Career context: While at the public library, my role was to be a technology guide for the public. I educated people on current and emerging technologies and the greater context of what they meant for us as a society and our future. However, I decided I wanted a more direct impact in the technology world as a developer and accepted a front-end development and UX design internship with Occipital. At this point, I was more aware of what UX design was but didn’t understand the full practice or profession. One of my goals with my internship was to learn more about UX design from the San Francisco UX designer at the company. In the end, my UX engineer manager was my primary mentor.</p>
							<p>Problem context: Occipital is a computer vision product company. One of their primary offerings is a mixed reality headset that their developer community can build mobile apps for. The developer advocate wanted a place on the Bridge headset website to feature these apps that would demonstrate the versatile uses of the headset.</p>

				                        There a multiple competitors in the market for virtual reality headsets. People are fascinated by the technology and enjoyed trying out a demo of the headset at events. Our marketing needed to go further though to convince interested customers to purchase the headset because it was useful. Showing the apps that customers could use with the app was a way to demonstrate this usefulness.

							<h2>Users and Audience</h2>
							<p>For designing the layout of the apps collection, I wanted to focus on making certain the Bridge headset's various application areas were clear. This would help potential customers see that the headset had a variety of software available as well as offering an innovative experience.</p>
                            <p>Another consideration the layout needed to account for was scalability and being future-proof enough so that update requests from the marketing department would be quick and easy to implement for the web engineering team.</p>

				                        My roles in creating the web page were designer and developer. I created the wireframes, low fidelity mockups, high fidelity mockups, and built the page in HTML, LESS, and JQuery. My manager, a UX Engineer, provided guidance through the process as this was done during an UX design and front-end development internship. Business requirements came from the developer advocate. Both my manager and the developer advocate were in San Francisco while I worked in Boulder, CO.

				                        Having a small web development team and one UX designer for the variety of products resulted in no formal UX process within the organization. Being newer to the field at this time, I trusted the guidance of my manager and mentor and designed the web page primarily from business requirements provided by the developer advocate. There were no research or strategy phases applied to this project and our fast-paced environment often skipped these activities in favor of A/B testing later, a more lean startup approach.

										The original ask was to create a web page for all the compatible apps for the Structure Sensor product, a room scanning device that easily attaches to and runs on an iPad. Eventually the page was made to be specific to the Bridge headset.

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>There was no user research phase for this project, but my manager did advise me to reference how other organizations had solved this problem for their own app stores, especially those in the AR/VR space. Some solved it by displaying a subset of apps for a category and linking to a full category page for them. Others solved it using carousels. UX research studies from firms such as Neilson Norman Group show that carousels aren’t effective for displaying content. That idea wasn’t moved forward.
							</p>
							<p>
							With the guidance of my manager, I iterated on a series of wireframes, low fidelity mockups, and high fidelity mockups in Sketch. I focused primarily on the desktop experience but created a few layouts for mobile. The beginning wireframes were kept in grayscale to help my manager and others focus on the page structure without image assets or colors to distract them. With feedback from each iteration, I slowly added more detail so my manager could provide more robust feedback.
							</p>
							<p>
								Feedback from my manager asked to consider the following:<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>How does the structure look when categories have different numbers of apps?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The structure is the same. Overflow apps are displayed by clicking “See More”.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>How does it look on tablet or a phone?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The final design in production has a card design for each app listing. This organize into a scrollable list for mobile devices.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>Is there a way to show the same number of apps for all categories to keep the layout predictable?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I settled on displaying 3 applications per category with a “See More” button beneath them.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>Is it more useful to display an image from the app or the icon?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I settled on showing both so the user could have a preview of the app experience and know what icon to look for in the app store listing.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>Should the app producer be included in the listing? How?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The app producer was added beneath the app name.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>How much written info does the user need to browse listings?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I addressed this by shortening the description to the app’s tagline.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>How is phone compatibility clarified?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Apple and Android icons were added to each listing.</li>
								</ul>

								<li>How is each listing better delineated?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Creating a more card style layout helped make each listing more visually separate.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>

							<h2>Outcomes</h2>
                            <p>Designing this page was one of the last pieces I worked on before finishing my internship at Occipital. The web page that launched was similar to but not exactly like the most recent design iteration I had completed before leaving. Moving forward my next steps for evaluating the effectiveness of this page would be to monitor Google analytics to understand customer engagement with the content and if headset purchases increased within a set time frame after launching and promoting the page. I would also partner with the customer service team to monitor inquiries about the headset’s applications.
