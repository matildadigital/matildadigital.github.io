							<h1>Aerospace Alliance App</h1>
							<p class="major">The Aerospace Alliance serves to establish the Southeast region as a world-class aerospace and aviation corridor. Business leaders interested in working with Alliance companies needed to easily understand them, their products, and their services. I designed this app to replace the bulky catalogs that previously filled this need.</p>

							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Career context: Before moving to Denver to start graduate school, my manager at Mav6 referred me for a project with the Aerospace Alliance. As a Mav6 business analyst, I started taking on more design work from our swamped user interface designer. I discovered that there were more ways to communicate beyond the written word, audio, and video as I’d learned studying broadcast communication. I had no project management experience and had never led design on a project before, but I was too excited at the opportunity to design an app to worry about that. At this point, I was very interested in user interface design and had applied to work as a graphic designer at the University of Denver.</p>
							<p>Problem Context: According to its website, the Aerospace Alliance’s mission is “to establish the Southeast region as a world-class aerospace and aviation corridor. The Alliance’s member states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, share the goal of promoting the region’s common assets and long-standing tradition of excellence in the aerospace industry to grow the sector in the region. Members advocate for policies, programs and specific aerospace projects on the local, state and national level.”</p>
							<p>The Aerospace Alliance was looking for help developing a mobile application. The mobile app would help business professionals looking for vendors to provide services or products for defense/space projects. These users needed a means of collecting and sharing information about the capabilities of various providers across the region.</p>

							<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
							<p>These professionals faced the issue of collecting heavy catalogs and marketing materials detailing the offerings of various providers across the region. They were bulky and cumbersome for travel, but necessary for sharing capability research with others in their companies. The goal was to create a more portable alternative that would provide information about what different defense/space companies offered and give the Alliance’s member companies the opportunity to better market themselves.</p>

				                        For this project, I served as the project manager and the experience designer. At this point, the UX disciplines I practiced were user interface and interaction design. I recruited a graphic designer and mobile developer by researching LinkedIn and asking others for recommendations. The graphic designer created the visual identity and image assets, such as the app icon. Our mobile developer built the application in Titanium so it’d be compatible for most smartphones.

				                        This contract was conducted completely remote from Denver, CO. I never met my client or recruited teammates in person, who mostly lived in Mississippi. I was also brand new to independent contracting and figuring out how to conduct the engagement as I went along. Instead of setting a budget at the beginning, I checked with my client to get approval for spending.

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>During initial meetings, my client and I discussed the details of the project in greater detail. The mobile application had a couple needs to fill. First it would consolidate capability and contact information for providers across the each in one easy to navigate application, Second, it would offer news updates on the providers to help promote them and keep users informed of new offerings. Lastly, the application needed to have an easy means of updating its content so the Alliance could maintain it. This helped me gain a better understanding of what problems the app should solve and the scope of the work.</p>
							<p>Next, I created wireframes for the app. Wireframes would provide the opportunity get feedback from the client on functions that may not make sense for the users and feedback from the developer on any technical limitations. Most feedback was based on how certain choices affected the end cost. The client, having little background in creating software from scratch, had little feedback at this phase.</p>
							<p>After creating wireframes, I moved on to developing more high-fidelity mockups of the screens for the mobile developer to follow and the graphic designer to base her visual designs from. This provided the developer with a final concept of how to move forward building the app.*</p>
							<p>After handing off the high fidelity mockups, I provided clarifications on requirements and took on more of a project management role until the app released to the store.</p>
							<p>During this time, I provided updates to the client on the status of work and new accomplishments such as finishing wireframes or the developer setting up the server for the application.</p>
							<p>*Note: I understand now that this isn’t the proper process for a UX designer. Proper user research and more prototyping were missing from this project. This process represents what I knew to do at that point in time. I’ve learned since then that when a project or product manager speaks on behalf of users or customers instead of creating time in the development process for research that it may be a sign that the organization is still growing its understanding of the design thinking process and how to integrate it into its work flow.</p>

							<h2>Outcomes</h2>
							<p>This contract was a big stretch and career development opportunity for me. It was my first venture in project management and leading the design of an application, all remotely! I learned strategies for recruiting partners on a project, setting and managing client expectations, and gained experience collaborating with a remote team.</p>
							<p>The mobile app was successfully released to the Apple and Google Play app stores which concluded the project. However, today the app is no longer available. Having grown as a professional in the tech industry and as a UX designer, I better understand the reasons for this.</p>
							<p>When I look back on this project, there’s a good chance that conducting robust user research and discovery process with the organization at the outset would have ended in a different solution. As a trade organization with a limited budget, it would have been wiser to estimate the base cost of building a similar mobile app  and  maintaining it overtime so they would understand the financial commitment to provide this solution. Most likely the app is no longer available because the organization chose to forgo this cost. User research would have provided the opportunity to find what the true underlying problem was for these business professionals and validate if a mobile app would actually solve it through a prototype. This would have saved the client money on production costs for something they chose to stop offering. It would have also opened the client up to other solutions that potentially cost less or uncovered a different problem entirely.</p>

							<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                            <p>The app was developed with an adminstrative portal for managing content, e.g. adding news articles and changing supplier information. In the next release, the app would be better as a platform where individual suppliers and manufacturers would maintain news and content for their own listing, similar to social media equivalents like Facebook's Pages. While this would add the need for content governance to managing the app, it would relieve the organization of content creation and management while preserving the app's value.</p>
