							<h1>Aerospace Alliance’s mobile app design and project management</h1>
							<p class="major">The Aerospace Alliance serves to establish the Southeast region as a world-class aerospace and aviation corridor. Business leaders interested in working with Alliance companies needed to easily understand them, their products, and their services. I designed this app to replace the bulky catalogs that previously filled this need.</p>

							<h2>Case Study Summary</h2>
							<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
							<p>These professionals faced the issue of collecting heavy catalogs and marketing materials detailing the offerings of various providers across the region. They were bulky and cumbersome for travel, but necessary for sharing capability research with others in their companies. The goal was to create a more portable alternative that would provide information about what different defense/space companies offered and give the Alliance’s member companies the opportunity to better market themselves.</p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>For this project, I served as the project manager and the experience designer. At this point, the UX disciplines I practiced were user interface and interaction design. I recruited a graphic designer and mobile developer by researching LinkedIn and asking others for recommendations. The graphic designer created the visual identity and image assets, such as the app icon. Our mobile developer built the application in Titanium so it’d be compatible for most smartphones.</p>
							<h3>Outcomes</h3>
							<p>This contract was a big stretch and career development opportunity for me. It was my first venture in project management and leading the design of an application, all remotely! I learned strategies for recruiting partners on a project, setting and managing client expectations, and gained experience collaborating with a remote team.</p>
							<p>The mobile app was successfully released to the Apple and Google Play app stores which concluded the project. However, today the app is no longer available. Having grown as a professional in the tech industry and as a UX designer, I better understand the reasons for this.</p>
							<p>When I look back on this project, there’s a good chance that conducting a robust user research and discovery process with the organization at the outset would have ended in a different solution. As a trade organization with a limited budget, it would have been wiser to estimate the base cost of building a similar mobile app and maintaining it overtime so they would understand the financial commitment to provide this solution. Most likely the app is no longer available because the organization chose to forgo this cost. User research would have provided the opportunity to find what the true underlying problem was for these business professionals and validate if a mobile app would actually solve it through a prototype. This would have saved the client money on production costs for something they chose to stop offering. It would have also opened the client up to other solutions that potentially cost less or uncovered a different problem entirely.</p>
