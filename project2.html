							<h1>Aerospace Alliance App</h1>
							<p class="major">The Aerospace Alliance serves to establish the Southeast region as a world-class aerospace and aviation corridor. Business leaders interested in working with Alliance companies needed to easily understand them and their products and services. I designed this app to replace the bulky catalogs that previously filled this need.</p>

							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>Occipital partners with startup companies in the computer vision space
                            to create applications for its product Bridge, a mixed reality headset. They wanted potential customers to have a way to easily understand what they could do with the headset, i.e. what apps are available for it, to encourage them to buy it.</p>

							<h2>Methods: Wireframing</h2>
							<p>For designing the layout of the apps collection, I wanted to focus on make certain the Bridge headset's various application areas were clear. This would help potential customers see that headset had a variety of software available as well as offering a innovative experience.</p>
                            <p>Another consideration the layout needed to account for was scalability and being future-proof enough so that update requests from the marketing department would be quick and easy to implement for the web engineering team.</p>

							<h2>Methods: Interface Design</h2>
							<p>For the interface design, I considered the connection between the customer's experience on Occipital's website and their experience in the iOS or Android app stores linked to the website. They would need a visual cue upon navigating away that would connect the two experiences. To solve this problem I experimented with the proper placement of the app icon and selecting a informative screenshot for each app. The app screenshot also showed the user what their experience of the app might be like and provide evidence that the Bridge headset worked with relevant, useful software.</p>

							<h2>Outcomes</h2>
                            <p>The final design launched on the website was a card style layout more in keeping with one of the initial iteration of design. The app screenshot is the focus of each app listing with the icon and brief description below. A slight animation on each card shows the user the item is clickable so they can navigate to its apps page.
